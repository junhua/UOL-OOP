# Project Brief

## Course Context
This is the Object-Oriented Programming (CM2005) course project, a module for first-year computer science students, serving as their first programming module. It consists of three main components: Tutorial, Lab, and Project.

## Components

1.  **Tutorial**:
    -   Focuses on gradually introducing essential C++ and OOP concepts.
    -   Content is listed in `syllabus.ts`.

2.  **Lab**:
    -   Guides students to progressively build two complete programs:
        -   MerkelRex (Weather Prediction App) in Topics 1-5
        -   OtoDecks (DJ Application) in Topics 6-10

3.  **Project**:
    -   Assists students in completing their two assignments:
        -   Midterm: Weather Prediction App (MerkelRex)
        -   Final: DJ Application (OtoDecks)
    -   Provides guiding documents and boilerplates with comments.
    -   Requirements are in `Docs/ProjectBriefs/`.

## Goals

1.  Build a GitHub Page that can convert markdown files into an HTML page.
2.  Refine the Tutorial's content and helper code.
3.  Refine the Lab's content and helper code.
4.  Build the Project guiding documents and a few boilerplates with comments (each boilerplate contains a different way to implement the program based on the requirements).

## Core Requirements

### MerkelRex Requirements (Midterm)

-   Process weather data from a CSV file.
-   Compute candlestick data (Open, High, Low, Close).
-   Create a text-based plot of the candlestick data.
-   Filter data by date range and location.
-   Predict temperature changes and plot predictions.

### OtoDecks Requirements (Final)

-   Audio file loading and playback.
-   Deck controls (play, pause, stop, cue).
-   Waveform visualization.
-   Audio manipulation features (volume, speed).
-   GUI implementation.
-   Custom deck control component.
-   Music library component with search and persistent storage.
-   Implement a new feature inspired by a real DJ program.
