```

## Learning Path

### 1. Types of Comments
- Single-line comments (//)
- Multi-line comments (/* */)
- Documentation comments (/** */)
- When and how to use each type

### 2. Documentation Practices
- File headers
- Class documentation
- Function documentation
- Variable documentation
- Implementation notes

### 3. Code Formatting
- Indentation
- Spacing
- Line breaks
- Alignment
- Grouping related code

### 4. Naming Conventions
- Variable names
- Function names
- Class names
- Constant names
- Parameter names

## Building and Running

### Compile the program:
```bash
g++ comments.cpp -o comments
```

### Run the program:
```bash
./comments
```

## Exercise Steps
1. Start with comments_starter.cpp
2. Add appropriate comments
3. Improve code formatting
4. Use better variable names
5. Add documentation comments
6. Format output for readability

## Common Issues
1. Over-commenting obvious code
2. Under-commenting complex logic
3. Outdated comments
4. Inconsistent formatting
5. Poor naming choices
6. Redundant information

## Best Practices
- Write self-documenting code
- Comment complex logic
- Use meaningful names
- Be consistent with style
- Keep comments current
- Format for readability
- Follow team conventions

## Next Steps
- Review different commenting styles
- Practice documentation comments
- Experiment with formatting
- Improve variable naming
- Study code organization
- Learn documentation tools
