# Part 05: Basic Operators

## Overview
This part introduces students to C++ operators, including arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and increment/decrement operators. Students will learn about operator precedence and practice using operators in various expressions.

## Learning Path

### 1. Arithmetic Operators
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%)
- Type conversion effects

### 2. Assignment Operators
- Basic assignment (=)
- Compound assignment (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
- Chained assignments
- Operation combinations

### 3. Increment/Decrement
- Pre-increment (++x)
- Post-increment (x++)
- Pre-decrement (--x)
- Post-decrement (x--)
- Side effects

### 4. Comparison & Logical
- Equality operators (==, !=)
- Relational operators (<, >, <=, >=)
- Logical AND (&&)
- Logical OR (||)
- Logical NOT (!)

## Building and Running

### Compile the program:
```bash
g++ operators.cpp -o operators
```

### Run the program:
```bash
./operators
```

## Exercise Steps
1. Start with operators_starter.cpp
2. Implement arithmetic operations
3. Add assignment operations
4. Practice with increment/decrement
5. Create comparison examples
6. Test logical operations
7. Demonstrate precedence

## Common Issues
1. Integer division truncation
2. Operator precedence confusion
3. Pre/post increment misuse
4. Type conversion issues
5. Logical operator short-circuiting

## Best Practices
- Use parentheses for clarity
- Be careful with integer division
- Watch for increment/decrement side effects
- Consider type promotion
- Document complex expressions
- Test edge cases
- Break down complex operations

## Next Steps
- Experiment with different operators
- Try complex expressions
- Practice operator precedence
- Test type conversions
- Create calculator programs
- Handle edge cases
