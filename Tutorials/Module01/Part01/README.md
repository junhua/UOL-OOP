# Part 01: Welcome to C++ and Object-Oriented Programming

## Overview
This part introduces students to C++ programming and the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming. Students will set up their development environment and write their first C++ program.

└── Final/            # Complete implementations
    └── hello.cpp
```

## Learning Path

### 1. Environment Setup
- Install a C++ compiler
- Setup an IDE or text editor
- Verify the development environment

### 2. First Program
- Start with hello_starter.cpp
- Follow the TODO comments
- Compare with hello.cpp
- Understand each component

### 3. Key Concepts
- Basic program structure
- Including libraries
- Main function
- Output operations
- Return values

## Building and Running

### Compile the program:
```bash
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
```

### Run the program:
```bash
./hello
```

## Common Issues
1. Missing semicolons
2. Incorrect include statements
3. Mismatched brackets
4. Compiler not found

## Next Steps
- Experiment with different output messages
- Try multiple cout statements
- Understand error messages
- Review the final implementation
