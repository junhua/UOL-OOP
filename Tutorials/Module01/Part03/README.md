# Part 03: Variables and Data Types

## Overview
This part introduces students to C++ data types, variable declaration and initialization, type conversion, and common issues related to data types. Students will learn about different types of variables and how to use them effectively.

## Learning Path

### 1. Fundamental Data Types
- Integer types (short, int, long)
- Floating point types (float, double)
- Character type (char)
- Boolean type (bool)
- Type sizes and ranges

### 2. Variable Declaration
- Basic declaration syntax
- Initialization methods
- Multiple declarations
- Naming conventions
- Scope and lifetime

### 3. Type Conversion
- Implicit conversion
- Explicit casting
- Modern C++ casting
- Conversion safety
- Precision considerations

## Building and Running

### Compile the program:
```bash
g++ data_types.cpp -o data_types
```

### Run the program:
```bash
./data_types
```

## Exercise Steps
1. Start with data_types_starter.cpp
2. Declare variables of different types
3. Initialize variables with values
4. Display variable information
5. Experiment with type conversion
6. Test range limits and overflow

## Common Issues
1. Uninitialized variables
2. Integer overflow
3. Precision loss in conversion
4. Type mismatch errors
5. Implicit conversion risks

## Best Practices
- Always initialize variables
- Use appropriate types for data
- Be explicit about type conversions
- Check for potential overflow
- Consider memory usage
- Use meaningful variable names
- Format output for readability

## Next Steps
- Experiment with different data types
- Try various initialization methods
- Test type conversion scenarios
- Explore type limits and overflow
- Practice error handling
