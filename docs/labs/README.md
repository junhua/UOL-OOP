# Lab Materials Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the lab materials used in the Object-Oriented Programming (CM2005) course. The lab materials guide students through building two complete C++ applications:

1. **MerkelRex** (Topics 1-5): A text-based cryptocurrency trading simulator
2. **OtoDecks** (Topics 6-10): A GUI-based DJ application using the JUCE framework

## Documentation Approach

Each topic documentation includes:

1. **Implementation Details**: Step-by-step explanation of the code implementation
2. **OOP Concepts**: Explanation of the C++ and OOP concepts demonstrated
3. **Code Snippets**: Key code examples with explanations
4. **Visual Elements**: Textual descriptions of UI layouts and application states where applicable

## MerkelRex Application

The MerkelRex application is a text-based cryptocurrency trading simulator built in Topics 1-5. It demonstrates fundamental C++ concepts including:

- Function-based program structure
- Classes and objects
- File I/O and exception handling
- Algorithms and data structures
- Object interactions

## OtoDecks Application

The OtoDecks application is a GUI-based DJ application built in Topics 6-10 using the JUCE framework. It demonstrates more advanced C++ and OOP concepts including:

- GUI programming with JUCE
- Event-driven programming
- Class composition and inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Model-view architecture
