# Part 01: Welcome to C++ and Object-Oriented Programming

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what C++ is and its role in software development
- Learn about Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- Setup your development environment
- Write your first C++ program

## Introduction
Welcome to C++ programming! Think of learning C++ like learning a new language - just as you use English to communicate with people, you'll use C++ to communicate with computers. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is like organizing your thoughts and instructions in a way that mirrors real-world objects and their interactions.

## Core Concepts

### 1. What is C++?
- A powerful programming language
- Used for system software, games, and applications
- Combines low-level control with high-level features
- Supports multiple programming paradigms

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming
- A way of organizing code around objects
- Objects combine data and functions
- Makes code more organized and reusable
- Models real-world relationships

### 3. Development Environment
- Code editor or IDE
- Compiler
- Debugger
- Basic tools and setup

## Practice Exercise
1. Hello World Program
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   
   int main() {
       std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - Requirements: Create and run this basic program
   - Understand each line's purpose
   - Experiment with different messages

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting semicolons
- Missing brackets
- Incorrect file extensions
- Compiler errors understanding

## Further Reading
- C++ language history
- Modern C++ features
- OOP principles in depth
- Development environment tips
