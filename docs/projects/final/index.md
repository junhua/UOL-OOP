# OtoDecks Audio Player Project

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for implementing the OtoDecks audio player project. The project involves developing a DJ application with custom deck controls, a music library system, and advanced audio playback features.

## Project Overview

The OtoDecks audio player is designed to be a functional DJ application with two decks for mixing tracks. The project builds upon basic functionality (R1) and extends it with custom interfaces and advanced features.

1. Read and play audio files
2. Control playback (play, pause, stop)
3. Manipulate audio (speed, volume)
4. Display waveforms
5. Manage a music library
6. Mix between two decks

## Key Requirements

1. **Basic Functionality (R1)**:
   - Audio file loading and playback
   - Basic transport controls
   - Volume and speed adjustment
   - Waveform display
   - Two independent decks
   - Simple playlist management

2. **Custom User Interface (R2)**:
   - Custom deck control Component
   - Professional visual design
   - Intuitive control layout
   - Responsive user interaction
   - Custom graphics and animations

3. **Advanced Features (R3)**:
   - Feature implementation inspired by professional DJ software
   - Enhanced music library management
   - Additional audio controls and effects
   - Performance optimizations
   - Extended mixing capabilities

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

1. **MainComponent**: Central application window containing:
   - Two deck instances
   - Music library interface
   - Mixing controls

2. **DJAudioPlayer**: Core audio functionality:
   - File loading and playback
   - Transport control
   - Audio manipulation
   - Buffer management

3. **DeckGUI**: Custom interface for each deck:
   - Transport buttons
   - Control sliders
   - Custom graphics
   - User interaction handling

4. **WaveformDisplay**: Audio visualization:
   - Waveform rendering
   - Playhead tracking
   - Zoom controls
   - Beat markers

5. **PlaylistComponent**: Music library management:
   - Track listing
   - Search functionality
   - Metadata display
   - Drag and drop support

## Things to Note

1. **Audio Processing**:
   - Handle audio buffers efficiently
   - Manage memory for large files
   - Implement smooth playback control
   - Consider latency in mixing operations

2. **User Interface**:
   - Design for intuitive workflow
   - Provide visual feedback
   - Maintain consistent styling
   - Support keyboard shortcuts

3. **JUCE Framework**:
   - Utilize appropriate JUCE classes
   - Follow JUCE design patterns
   - Handle component lifecycle
   - Manage audio thread safety

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Validate file operations
   - Handle audio format issues
   - Manage resource constraints
   - Provide user feedback

5. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Optimize graphics rendering
   - Efficient audio processing
   - Smooth user interface updates
   - Resource management

## Implementation Tasks

- [Task 1: Custom Deck Control Interface](task1.html)
- [Task 2: Advanced DJ Features](task2.html)
- [Task 3: Music Library System](task3.html)

## Getting Started

To begin implementing the OtoDecks project:

1. Review the existing R1 implementation
2. Understand the JUCE application structure
3. Plan your custom user interface design
4. Research professional DJ software features
5. Implement requirements progressively

Remember to test thoroughly at each stage and maintain clean, well-documented code throughout development.
